Email Spam Filtering Using Machine Learning Algorithims Using Python

Made use of Machine Learning Algorithms to designate whether an email is a spam or not spam(ham). The dataset used contained close to 20,000 emails with ham:spam ratio approximately 60:40. Analysed results obtained from SVM, Naive Bayes Classification and Decision Tree which concluded in results being application centric. This designation of emails as spam or ham is partly based on the frequency of the words appeared in your known set of spam and ham which is called as feature matrix and then feeding it to each algorithms. In order to improve results, stop words like and, or, etc were removed, brought all the words to its root(eg playing to play) which is called as stemming and made use of Term frequency-Inverse Document Frequency to finally build this feature matrix.
